# NLP-Classifying-Newsletter-Genre
NLP problem which takes in data in the form of school newsletters, and predicts what 'genre' or 'type' it is. 
These newsletters are grouped into separate categories, such as 'ANNONCEMENTS", 'BREAKING NEWS', 'UPCOMING EVENTS' etc.
The use case for a model like this would be to make a streamlined website which can automatically decide under which page/location a certain newsletter should be uploaded.
For example, we can make a code to automatticaly e-mail 'PTO' related newsletters to the parents, while something like 'UPCOMING EVENTS' can be mailed to students, and 'BREAKING NEWS' can be placed on the website's front page.
